# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** The pipeline produces high-quality product content reliably at scale — decomposition and bug fixes must not regress the 98% human approval rate or break any existing API endpoints.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Schemas Extraction

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Schemas Extraction)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Roadmap created, all 38 requirements mapped across 7 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Decompose before fixing bugs — modular isolation makes bug fixes safer and more testable
- [Roadmap]: Phase 7 (Bing fix) depends on Phase 4 (protocol established) but is independent of Phases 5-6
- [Roadmap]: Provider abstraction (Phase 5) placed after GPT-5.2 fixes (Phase 4) — evaluation needs a clean baseline
- [Project]: Never batch prompt changes — one change per PR, deploy, curl `920D-6`, verify >500 chars (Phase 27 learning)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude structured output API path unresolved — `output_config.format.json_schema` vs `tool_choice`. Reconcile before Phase 5 planning.
- [Research]: Extended thinking + structured output compatibility with Claude not confirmed. Affects `reasoning_effort` mapping in ClaudeProvider.
- [Phase 6]: 10 SKU evaluation set not yet defined — Bobby/Robert must confirm selection before Phase 6 begins.
